we can first look at this log file and see if its large (not worth looking for word for word )or small 

```bash
cat server.log | wc -l
2348
```



As we can see, invetigating this file can be a pain so how do we solve this.
so we can search up things and see what we can find:
we can use fail, sucess, flag and many more so i will skip to the chasse and see which will work :



```bash
cat server.log  | grep -i "flag" | cut -d ':' -f4 | sort | uniq

 cedfa5fb}
 picoCTF{us3_
 sk1lls_
 y0urlinux_
```

if we reconstruct our flag we get this:

```bash
picoCTF{us3_y0urlinux_sk1lls_cedfa5fb}
```

Nice huh!!!
